# Welcome to Round 3 of your React Interview

> This round is to test your practical knowledge of using React in real world applications.
> The repo serves as a boilerplate for the React application you are going to build.
> The boilerplate is created using `create-react-app`.

> **_Please read the below instructions carefully_**

### **Before starting keep in mind the below points**

- The repo is configured with ESlint to check the code quality of your javascript code.
- The repo is configured with Stylelint to check the code quality of CSS.
- Failing the rules set by the above linters will prevent you from committing to this repo
- The Project will show some VS Code plugins as recommendations, that help you regarding these linter, ESLint, Stylelint, Editorconfig, etc. Install these plugins for better experience.
- Has bootstrap, react-router, many other libraries which you might need pre-installed.
- You can install other npm packages if you want
- Upon completing the problem, commit to your forked github repo and share the github repo url with us for review
- Writing inline CSS is discouraged, utilise bootstrap or write your custom CSS in separate CSS files or CSS modules.
- Create a `.env` by copying `.env.example` which contains your environment variables
- UI must be responsive
- Can use any online resources to solve the problem
- Use [`fetch API`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) to make API calls instead of `axios`. Use `JSON.stringify` to convert the body to string when doing any POST request.
- You have a total of **2 hrs** to complete the task
